API (Restfull/JSON) documentation
=================================

This documentation describes the Glances API version 4 (Restfull/JSON) interface.

For Glances version 3, please have a look on:
``https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/blob/support/glancesv3/docs/api.rst``

Run the Glances API server
--------------------------

The Glances Restfull/API server could be ran using the following command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    # glances -w --disable-webui

It is also ran automatically when Glances is started in Web server mode (-w).

API URL
-------

The default root API URL is ``http://localhost:61208/api/4``.

The bind address and port could be changed using the ``--bind`` and ``--port`` command line options.

It is also possible to define an URL prefix using the ``url_prefix`` option from the [outputs] section
of the Glances configuration file.

Note: The url_prefix should always end with a slash (``/``).

For example:

.. code-block:: ini
    [outputs]
    url_prefix = /glances/

will change the root API URL to ``http://localhost:61208/glances/api/4`` and the Web UI URL to
``http://localhost:61208/glances/``

API documentation URL
---------------------

The API documentation is embeded in the server and available at the following URL:
``http://localhost:61208/docs#/``.

WebUI refresh
-------------

It is possible to change the Web UI refresh rate (default is 2 seconds) using the following option in the URL:
``http://localhost:61208/glances/?refresh=5``


GET API status
--------------

This entry point should be used to check the API status.
It will the Glances version and a 200 return code if everything is OK.

Get the Rest API status::

    # curl -I http://localhost:61208/api/4/status
    "HTTP/1.0 200 OK"

* **available**: The actual amount of available memory that can be given instantly to processes that request more memory in bytes; this is calculated by summing different memory values depending on the platform (e.g. free + buffers + cached on Linux) and it is supposed to be used to monitor actual memory usage in a cross platform fashion (unit is *bytes*)
* **percent**: The percentage usage calculated as (total - available) / total * 100 (unit is *percent*)
* **used**: Memory used, calculated differently depending on the platform and designed for informational purposes only (unit is *bytes*)
* **free**: Memory not being used at all (zeroed) that is readily available; note that this doesn't reflect the actual memory available (use 'available' instead) (unit is *bytes*)
* **active**: *(UNIX)*: memory currently in use or very recently used, and so it is in RAM (unit is *bytes*)
* **inactive**: *(UNIX)*: memory that is marked as not used (unit is *bytes*)
* **buffers**: *(Linux, BSD)*: cache for things like file system metadata (unit is *bytes*)
* **cached**: *(Linux, BSD)*: cache for various things (unit is *bytes*)
* **wired**: *(BSD, macOS)*: memory that is marked to always stay in RAM. It is never moved to disk (unit is *bytes*)
* **shared**: *(BSD)*: memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple processes (unit is *bytes*)
